ICRO Web Tool - Dev Setup Guidelines
====================================

1) Install Apache, Mysql, PHP
2) Grab a copy of the repository, put it in /var/www/html/ICRO-Web-Tool (owned by apache user)
3) Create a blank DB called 'icroweb'
4) Use icro/data/icroweb.basic.sql to create the contents of this DB
5) Point your web browser at http://your-ip/icro/
6) Login with admin/admin (default user)

Obviously don't use this to do anything serious - you'd need to 
make several changes, not limited to:

  * move the config outside the webroot
  * update the classes files to point at new config path
  * replace default user with actual users/passwords
  * allow mysql to take packets of up to 16M (for document blobs)

Thats about it,

Dave
