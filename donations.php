The Irish Cave Rescue Organisation (ICRO), is a national voluntary body and registered charity (No. 10736) which co-ordinates and manages cave rescue operations in Ireland. It is funded by the Irish Coast Guard in the Republic of Ireland and Sports Northern Ireland in the north and works in co-operation with An Garda Siochana and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) It comprises active cavers throughout Ireland and Northern Ireland - a core group of 50 members and a larger general group of about 200 - who can be called upon in the event of accidents in caves, potholes and abandoned mines. Whether people or animals, day or night, ICRO personnel are there to help.
<br/><br/>
ICRO is a specialist organisation - its training and skills are the best in the country for dealing with underground incidents, but it also uses these skills for more, annually providing medical assistance and first aid for the Clare Burren Marathon and on Croagh Patrick each Reek Sunday. Farmers can also contact ICRO if their livestock have fallen into a pothole on their land. ICRO's volunteers are selfless in their motivation but specialists in their field and are always on standby.
<br/><br/>
There is no organisation in the country that hasn't been affected by the recession and in ICRO's case, its 2011 funding was reduced by &euro;12,000. While challenging, this has has not deterred the organisation and despite the funding cuts, it continues to provide an expert emergency rescue service. But such a service needs to be maintained and that is where your help comes in.
<br/><br/>
Your fundraising support will enable ICRO to purchase essential rescue items such as: First Aid supplies; specialised communications equipment essential for cave rescue; vertical rope rescue equipment; stretcher and casualty protection items; helmets and lights. Funding is also essential to provide First Aid and communications courses and other skills training throughout the year; and to maintain its two cave rescue stores in counties Clare and Fermanagh.
